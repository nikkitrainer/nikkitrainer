- 👋 Hi, I’m @nikkitrainer
- 👀 I’m interested in research culture, ethics, integrity and behaviour change to improve scientific rigour and reproducibility...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about human mindsets and how as a trainer I can support individuals to switch into a growth mindset to improve the achievement of learning outcomes...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate to investigate the effectiveness of different training methods to develop good practice guidance that trainers of research scientists, students and technicians can use to improve learning outcomes and drive cultural change....
